## Distributed Systems

## What is a distributed system?
At a basic level, a distributed system is a collection of computers that work together 
to form a single end-user computer. All of these distributed machines have a shared state and operate concurrently.
They are capable of independently failing without harming the entire system, just like microservices. 
These self-contained, interdependent computers are connected by a network to share information, communicate and exchange information easily.

## Pros
Distributed systems can be difficult to implement and maintain, but there are many benefits to this design. Let's look at some of these benefits.

Scaling: A distributed system allows you to scale horizontally so that you can account for more traffic.
Modular growth: There's almost no limit to how much you can scale.
Fault Tolerance: Distributed systems are more tolerant of faults than a single machine.
Affordable: The initial cost is higher than a traditional system, but thanks to their scalability they quickly become more affordable
Low latency: Users can have a node in multiple locations, so traffic will reach the closest node
Efficiency: Distributed systems break complex data into smaller pieces
Parallelism: Distributed systems can be designed for parallelism, where multiple processors divide a complex problem into parts

## Cons
Fault Management: Fault management can be difficult with distributed systems because some components fail while others continue to function. This can often be an advantage for preventing large-scale failures, but it also brings added complexity when it comes to troubleshooting and debugging.
Concurrency: A common problem occurs when multiple clients try to access a shared resource at the same time. You must ensure that all resources are secure in a concurrent environment.
Security Issues: Security and data sharing have increased the risks in distributed computing systems. The network must be secure and users must be able to securely access data replicated in multiple locations.
Higher initial infrastructure costs: The initial cost of implementing a distributed system can be higher than that of a single system. This price includes basic network configuration issues, such as broadcasting, heavy load, and information loss.
