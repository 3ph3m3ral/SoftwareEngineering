file permission attributes on Linux:

rwxrwxrwx: Three sets of rwx. The leftmost set pertains to the
owner, the middle set is for the group, and the rightmost set is for
others; rwx stands for read (r), write (w), execute (x); the dash (-)
means no permission.

Other examples are:

           rwx------: Only the owner can read, write, and execute.
           
           rw-r--r--: Everyone can read, and the owner can also write.
           
           rw-------: Only the owner can read and write.
           
           r--r--r--: Everyone can read.

Permissions can also be expressed numerically, where read
(r) is equal to 4, write (w) is equal to 2, execute (x) is equal to 1,
and no permission is equal to 0. Therefore, 
           
           rwxrwxrwx is equal to 777, rwx------ is equal to 700

           rw-r--r-- is equal to 744, rws------- is equal to 600, and r--r--r-- is equal to 444



To change the permission and file/folder ownership, the follow-
ing commands can be used:

           · chmod: To change file/folder permission, example: chmod 755
           split.sh or chmod +x split.sh
           
           · chown: To change file ownership, example: chown user 2 split.sh
           
           · chgrp: To change folder ownership, example: chgrp group2
           split.sh
