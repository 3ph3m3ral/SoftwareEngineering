Design patterns are design patterns that can be used to solve common problems in object-based software design. Here are some of the main design patterns for object oriented programming:

Singleton: Allows you to create a class that can only have one instance.

Factory: Defines an interface to create an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Prototype: allows you to create new instances of an object by copying an existing one.

Adapter: Converts a class's interface to another interface that the client will wait for.

Bridge: Separates the abstraction from the implementation so that the two can vary independently.

Decorator: adds new functionality to an object dynamically, without changing its interface.

Facade: Provides a simplified interface for a set of classes in a subsystem.

Template Method: defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, leaving the subclasses the possibility to define the specific steps.

Observer: Allows an object to be notified of changes to another object.

Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, so you can use different objects for requests, parameters for requests, and the request forwarding mechanism.
